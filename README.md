# Numerical analysis of jamming criticality for spheroidal particles
### Yann-Edwin Keta, Umeå universitet, 2017

This research project was started at Umeå universitet, under the supervision of Peter Olsson, during the Spring 2017. We developed and adapted methods and models from the study of static or sheared packings of spheres to the study of sheared packings of spheroids. These allowed us to investigate the critical behaviours observed at the jamming transition and the other behaviours observed near the rheological transition of packings of soft-core frictionless spheroids. We showed that our models give results in good accordance with existing literature and pointed out interesting phenomena which could give new insights into the jamming transition.

These notes contain presentations of our model and methods, as well as figures and remarks about our results.

It can be read via this project [GitHub page](https://yketa.github.io/Umea_2017_Notes), or by cloning this repository and using `make`
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yketa/Umea_2017_Notes

```
then opening the `main.pdf` file.
```bash
