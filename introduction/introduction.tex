**** granular materials have lots of interesting and intriguing properties, yet too little is known about them, their understanding is great challenge of our time and would have lots of theoretical (phase transitions) and practical (natural catastrophes) implications \cite{youtube4} ****\\

**** modifications which have been added to currently existing C algorithms ****\\

**** simulations with 64 particles on 1 core and 1024 particles on 4 cores on computers provided by the Department of Physics at Ume√• University, simulations with 16384 particles on 12 cores on super computer provided by the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing at High Performance Computing Center North (HPC2N) ****
